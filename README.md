# case_study_bellabeat
Data analysis project involving a hypothetical case study of a company manufacturing smart devices.

## Bellabeat
High-tech manufacturer of women's health products.

### Goals:
What?	Make Bellabeat the company that most engages 	customers in the sector.
 
How?	Find valuable insights into users' routines and 	thus create new strategies for the company to 	engage its customers.

### Sample

* This dataset was generated between 03/12/2016 and 05/12/2016.

* It has 30 users and includes minute-level results for physical activity and sleep monitoring.

* This data set does not distinguish gender, so we will provide general insights!

### Strategies

* For greater user engagement, it is suggested to create a reward system for each MET achievement.

* The company could send alerts to users on the days and times when there are fewer people exercising, as this would prevent the user from crowded gyms.

* The device could also help with a routine to improve sleep quality, such as reminding people that it is important to avoid caffeine close to bedtime.

### Future analyses

* This data set does not distinguish gender, so it would be important to carry out an analysis only with women.

* For each strategy mentioned, it would be interesting to do research with the target audience about it.

* It would also be interesting to monitor users for a longer period of time to see if they are having a better quality of life.
